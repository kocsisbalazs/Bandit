# Bandit Bash Solutions

A set of one-shot Bash scripts to automate OverTheWire Bandit levels. No fluffâ€”just SSH commands, pipes and file parsing.

## What this is

Each script targets one Bandit level, logs in over SSH, extracts the password (via parsing, redirects, `grep`, `base64`, etc.) and hands it off to the next script. You get a reproducible chain from level 0 up.

## Prerequisites

You need:

- A Unix-style shell (bash 4+).  
- `ssh` client.  
- Coreutils: `grep`, `tr`, `cut`, `base64`, `xxd`, `openssl`, `find`, `sed`, `awk`.

## Repo layout

Scripts live at the root:
